    "For a **Staff Applied Scientist, Ads Quality (Ranking) role at Etsy**, a manager will likely ask behavioral questions focused on leadership, problem-solving, collaboration, and impact. Here are some sample questions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Leadership & Influence**  \n",
    "1. Tell me about a time you led a project that significantly improved an ad ranking system.  \n",
    "2. Describe a situation where you influenced cross-functional stakeholders (e.g., engineers, product managers) to adopt a new ranking model.  \n",
    "3. Have you mentored junior scientists or engineers? Can you share an example of how you helped them grow?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem-Solving & Technical Decision-Making**  \n",
    "4. Give an example of a time when you had to balance **relevance vs. revenue** in an ad ranking model. How did you approach the tradeoff?  \n",
    "5. Describe a complex machine learning ranking problem you solved. What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?  \n",
    "6. Have you encountered a situation where your ranking model performed well offline but poorly in production? How did you debug and resolve the issue?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cross-Functional Collaboration**  \n",
    "7. Tell me about a time you worked with a product team to define ad ranking objectives. How did you ensure alignment?  \n",
    "8. Describe a situation where you had to explain a complex ML model to a non-technical stakeholder. How did you approach it?  \n",
    "9. Give an example of a time when you had to work with engineers to optimize an ML model for production efficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Innovation & Impact**  \n",
    "10. Have you ever proposed a novel approach to improve ranking or ads quality? What was the outcome?  \n",
    "11. Tell me about a time you made a small change to an ad ranking model that led to a significant impact.  \n",
    "12. How have you used **exploration-exploitation (multi-armed bandits, reinforcement learning, etc.)** to improve ad ranking?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Setbacks & Learning from Mistakes**  \n",
    "13. Tell me about a time when your ML model or ranking system did not perform as expected. What did you learn?  \n",
    "14. Describe a time you faced pushback on an ML-driven decision. How did you handle it?  \n",
    "15. Have you ever launched an experiment that failed? What did you take away from it?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like help crafting responses or structuring your answers using the **STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) framework**?"
