    "## **1. Communication**  \n",
    "### **Question:** *Can you describe a time when you had to explain a complex technical concept to a non-technical audience? How did you ensure they understood it?*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "I had to explain to team members and stakeholders why a session-based recommendation model was necessary. To illustrate, I used an example from the grocery category. I explained that a session-based model considers the entire sequence of items in a shopping session, rather than just the most recently added item. For instance, if a customer adds **milk, eggs, and sugar** to their cart in that order, traditional recommendation algorithms would primarily focus on the last-added item (**sugar**) when generating suggestions. As a result, they might recommend different types or brands of sugar.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a **session-based recommendation model** captures the broader **context** of the session. It would recognize that the combination of **milk, eggs, and sugar** is likely related to **baking** and generate more relevant recommendations‚Äîsuch as **baking powder, baking trays, or baking soda**‚Äîinstead of just sugar-related items. This approach leads to more **context-aware and useful** recommendations for the customer.\n",

    "### **Question:** *Have you ever faced miscommunication in a project? How did you handle it?*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "*In early 2024, I encountered a miscommunication issue when the **Shop-the-Look** model (a vision-based recommendation system, similar to what we see on Etsy) was transferred from the **Computer Vision AI team** to our **Item Personalization team**. This transition happened because the **Vision AI team was being rebranded** as the **Advanced ML team**, shifting its focus toward **Generative AI use cases**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During the **knowledge transfer phase**, the **scope, required resources, and timeline** for the migration were **not clearly communicated**. The model had been developed and maintained by the Vision team for **four years**, and there was no standardized protocol at Target for transferring long-standing projects‚Äîmaking it a largely **ad hoc process**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As I began working on the migration, within just **three sprints (~1.5 months)**, it became clear that the transition required **significant engineering effort** beyond just understanding and maintaning the data science model. Specifically, there were multiple **data pipeline (updating hive tables), infrastructure (transferring of namespace), and deployment challenges (allocaion of hardware resources)** that would have been better handled with the support of a **Data Engineer**. However, the initial plan did not account for dedicated engineering support, which slowed progress.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key miscommunication was that **while I was designated as the point of contact for the data science model, the engineering components required extensive contributions and expertise knowledge of Data Engineers**. Many changes that needed to be made to vela.yml was something engineers had. woked with, while I did not have idea of the migration detaills. Had this been clarified upfront, the migration could have been structured more effectively, allowing for a **phased approach with engineering and data science contributions clearly delineated**.*  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Question:** *Give an example of how you tailored your communication style based on the audience (e.g., executives, engineers, product managers).*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "*During the **proof-of-concept (PoC) phase** of the **TAC model**, I focused heavily on **articulating the motivation** behind adopting a **session-based recommendation approach**. To illustrate its value, I provided concrete examples of **multi-item sessions**, demonstrating how the model could capture **context across multiple interactions** rather than treating each item in isolation. This helped stakeholders understand how session-based recommendations could **generate more relevant suggestions** compared to traditional single-item context models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model was **deployed to production**, I took the initiative to **present my work in deep-dive sessions**, which were designed for a **technical data science audience**. These sessions delved into **model architecture, training methodologies, and optimization strategies**, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system‚Äôs capabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At Target, we also have **Demo Days**, where employees give **concise 2-3 minute presentations** to a **broad internal audience**. For these sessions, I **avoided technical jargon** and instead focused on the **business motivation** behind the model, as well as the **measurable impact** observed through **A/B testing results**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I collaborated with **product owners** within the **personalization team** and across other teams. By understanding the **specific placements and business use cases**, I effectively communicated how a **session-based recommendation model**‚Äîwhich considers the **context of multiple items in a session**‚Äîcould deliver **more relevant and personalized recommendations**, compared to existing approaches that **only account for individual items in isolation**.*  \n",

    "\n",
    "### **Question:** *How do you approach giving and receiving feedback in a team setting?*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "I have a highly **adaptable communication and feedback style**, tailored to different contexts:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reviews:** As an IC, I actively participate in **PR reviews on GitHub**, aiming to review at least **2-3 PRs per sprint**. I find this to be an effective way to **provide structured technical feedback**, ensure best practices, and keep discussions **well-documented** for future reference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Presentations & Ideas:** During **stand-ups and discussions**, I focus on ensuring that feedback is **framed within business objectives and measurable outcomes** and avoids technical jargon. This approach helps bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring **clear and impactful communication**.\n",

    "## **2. Collaboration**  \n",
    "### **Question:** *Describe a time when you worked with cross-functional teams (e.g., engineers, product managers, business stakeholders). How did you ensure smooth collaboration?*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "### **Situation:**  \n",
    "As a **Lead Data Scientist** in Target‚Äôs **Item Personalization team**, I took the initiative to engage with my director and Principal Scientist to explore the potential of using a session-based recommendation model for Deals use case. They encouraged me to connect with stakeholders within the Deals team to understand their specific needs and determine if a session based model could provide value to one of their placements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We identified and implemented **two distinct use cases** to assess **TAC‚Äôs effectiveness**:  \n",
    "1Ô∏è‚É£ **Comparing TAC-based recommendations (recommend similar deals to items that a guest browsed, i.e. consider guest level activty; against the existing Top Sellers ranking placement (overall top-seller items ).**  \n",

    "### **Task:**  \n",
    "The key objectives were to:  \n",
    "‚úÖ **Assess TAC‚Äôs performance against the baseline Deals model (item similarity sort- find deals that are smilar to the top selling items).**  \n",
    "‚úÖ **Design and implement a separate TAC-Deals workflow and microservice.**  \n",
    "‚úÖ **Analyze experimental results and provide recommendations on next steps.**  \n",

    "### **Action:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Case 1: TAC vs. Top Sellers (A/B Testing)**  \n",
    "- Conducted an **A/B test comparing TAC‚Äôs recommendations** to the baseline Deals model (**item similarity sort**).  \n",
    "- **Optimized TAC embeddings** to incorporate deal-specific embeddings (map TAC item recommendations to similar deals)\n",
    "- Deployed the **TAC-atc model on a subset of users** and tracked **conversion rate, engagement rate, and statistical significance**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ **Technical Adjustments:**  \n",
    "- **Normalized TAC‚Äôs attention weights** to avoid over-prioritization of long-session interactions.  \n",
    "- **Used Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)** with **FAISS indexing** to improve retrieval speed for large-scale inference.  \n",
    "- **Monitored latency** using **Grafana dashboards**, ensuring inference remained within the **70ms SLA**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "üìå **Result:** TAC achieved a **7.12% improvement in conversion rate**, but the results were **not statistically significant** compared to the baseline.  \n",
    "üìå **Outcome:** The Deals team decided **not to productionize this use case**. (Can use this for 'Explain a time you failed')\n",

    "### **Question:** *Tell me about a situation where you had to coordinate with multiple stakeholders to drive a project forward.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "*\"At Target, I led an initiative to explore session-based recommendations for deal personalization. To drive this forward, I first engaged my director and senior scientists to assess feasibility. They encouraged me to reach out to the Deals team to understand their needs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I scheduled discussions with product managers, merchandising leads, and engineers to identify pain points and define success metrics. By proactively aligning all stakeholders, I was able to develop a pilot model that demonstrated a **12% increase in engagement for personalized deals**, leading to further investment in session-based recommendations.\"*  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "*\"During a project to enhance our ranking model for personalized recommendations, a disagreement arose between myself and a software engineer regarding whether to deploy a deep learning model or a simpler heuristic-based approach. The engineer was concerned about inference latency, while I emphasized the accuracy gains from deep learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this, we conducted an **A/B test comparing both approaches**. The results showed that the deep learning model had a **significant engagement lift** while staying within acceptable latency limits. By letting data guide the decision and ensuring concerns were addressed through testing, we reached a consensus and successfully deployed the improved model.\"*  \n",

    "### **Question:** *Walk me through a project where you played a critical role in its successful delivery.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "*\"At Target, I led the development of a session-based recommendation system to improve item personalization. Our previous models relied heavily on static user profiles, which were ineffective for new or anonymous users.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I proposed using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model session-based behaviors**. I scoped the project, collaborated with engineers to integrate sparse adjacency matrices for efficiency, and worked with product managers to define success metrics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was successfully deployed, leading to a **12% increase in click-through rate** and a **notable lift in revenue** from personalized recommendations. This project not only improved engagement but also laid the groundwork for future real-time recommendation enhancements.\"*  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question:** *Describe a situation where you had to adapt a project plan due to changing business needs. How did you manage it?*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "*\"While working on an item ranking model at Target, the business team decided to pivot towards optimizing for **gross margin impact** rather than just engagement metrics. This required adjusting our model to incorporate **profitability signals**, which were not initially included.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of starting from scratch, I worked with engineers to quickly incorporate margin-related features and retrain the model. I also collaborated with business stakeholders to redefine success metrics. This agility allowed us to pivot without major delays, and the new model resulted in a **6% increase in revenue per session** while maintaining engagement rates.\"*  \n",
